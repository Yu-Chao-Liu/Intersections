# Intersections

These matlab codes can read the morphological infos of a biocytin-filled neuron from a .swc file generated by Neuromantic or other softwares and analyse the number of intersection against vertical or horizontal axis with function of translation and/or rotation.

Firstly, run "changeextension" to copy the .swc files and change the extension to .txt in the same folder.

Secondly, prepare an excel file summarizing infos for translation, rotation, scaling and physical range and intervals for analysis (see the "Biocytin staining summary - example.xlsx").

Thirdly, run "intersections" to read the .txt files (reconstructions) and a summary excel file. It will generate three figures showing 1. dotted original tracing, 2. translated and rotated tracing + x_intersections, 3. translated and rotated tracing + y_intersections, and it will export an excel file summarizing the number of vertical and horizontal intersections and the normalized axonal density.
